### Optoelectrical properties of quasiplanar Ti/Si/Ti structures
:ru: Оптоэлектронные свойства квазипланарных структур Ti/Si/Ti

During this internship in summer 2019 I have been solving the following tasks:

1. [Reflection modeling](maxima/) (implemented on wxMaxima)

2. Electrical measurements

     2.1. Training using [Keysight](Keysight_34411A/) devices
  
     2.2. Measurements on [Keithley](keithley_2614B/) devices

### Acknowledgements
I'm grateful to Alexander Shurakov, head of the UHF devices department at TIRPhotonics, Anatoly Prikhodko and Denis Mikhaylov for this wonderful opportunity to get a real life experience in these key steps of development of a new device.
